Now to generate the Spring Boot Service class, we need to add the following dependencies to the project:

1. Spring Boot Starter Data JPA
2. Spring Boot Starter Web
3. H2 Database
4. Lombok

Once the dependencies are added, we can create the Spring Boot Service class with the following steps:

1. Create a package with the name com.lic.epgs.policyservicing.common.policylevelconversioncontroller.service
2. Create a Service class with the name PolicyLevelConversionService
3. Autowire the Repository class into the Service class
4. Add the required methods to the Service class
5. Build and run the project.

Finally, we have successfully generated the Spring Boot Service class for the given Repository.
